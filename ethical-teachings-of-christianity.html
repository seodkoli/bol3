The creeds of different Christian denominations usually hold in usual Jesus as the Kid of God&mdash;-- the Logo designs incarnated&mdash;-- who ministered, experienced, and died on a cross, yet climbed from the dead for the salvation of humankind; and described as the gospel, meaning the &quot;good news&quot;. The four canonical gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John define Jesus&#39;s life and trainings as preserved in the very early Christian custom, with the Old Testimony as the gospels&#39; reputable history. Christianity started in the first century, after the death of Jesus, as a Judaic sect with Hellenistic influence in the Roman province of Judaea.
