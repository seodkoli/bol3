<p>Christianity is an Abrahamic monotheistic religion, professing that Jesus Christ was elevated from the dead and is the Boy of God, whose coming as the Messiah was forecasted in the Hebrew Scriptures (called the Old Testament in Christianity) and narrated in the New Testament.

The creeds of different Christian religions usually hold in common Jesus as the Child of God&mdash;-- the Logo designs incarnated&mdash;-- who ministered, suffered, and died on a cross, yet increased from the dead for the salvation of humankind; and referred to as the scripture, suggesting the &quot;excellent information&quot;. The four approved gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John describe Jesus&#39;s life and teachings as preserved in the very early Christian tradition, with the Old Testimony as the scriptures&#39; recognized background. Christianity started in the first century, after the fatality of Jesus, as a Judaic sect with Hellenistic influence in the Roman province of Judaea. The disciples of Jesus spread their confidence around the Eastern Mediterranean location, in spite of substantial mistreatment. The addition of Gentiles led Christianity to gradually divide from Judaism (second century).

Protestantism divided into many religions from the Catholic Church in the Reformation era (16th century). Following the Age of Exploration (15th&ndash;-- 17th century), Christianity increased throughout the globe through missionary job, evangelism, migration and comprehensive profession. Christianity played a prominent duty in the growth of Western civilization, specifically in Europe from late classical times and the Middle Ages. The six major branches of Christianity are Roman Catholicism (1. 3 billion individuals), Protestantism (625 million-900 million), Eastern Orthodoxy (230 million), Asian Orthodoxy (60 million), Restorationism (35 million), and the Church of the East (600,000). Smaller church communities number in the thousands despite efforts towards unity (ecumenism). In the West, Christianity continues to be the dominant religious beliefs even with a decline in adherence, with about 70% of that population determining as Christian.
