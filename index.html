<p>Christianity is an Abrahamic monotheistic faith, proclaiming that Jesus Christ was elevated from the dead and is the Boy of God, whose coming as the Messiah was forecasted in the Hebrew Bible (called the Old Testimony in Christianity) and chronicled in the New Testament. It is the world&#39;s biggest and most prevalent religion with over 2. 4 billion fans, comprising around 31. 2% of the globe population. Its followers, known as Christians, are approximated to comprise a bulk of the populace in 157 nations and territories. Christianity continues to be culturally varied in its Western and Eastern branches, and doctrinally varied concerning justification and the nature of salvation, ecclesiology, consecration, and Christology. The creeds of various Christian denominations usually keep in typical Jesus as the Child of God&mdash;-- the Logo designs incarnated&mdash;-- that ministered, suffered, and died on a cross, however climbed from the dead for the salvation of humankind; and referred to as the scripture, suggesting the &quot;excellent information&quot;. The 4 canonical scriptures of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John explain Jesus&#39;s life and teachings as protected in the very early Christian custom, with the Old Testimony as the gospels&#39; respected background. Christianity began in the 1st century, after the death of Jesus, as a Judaic sect with Hellenistic impact in the Roman district of Judaea. The devotees of Jesus spread their faith around the Eastern Mediterranean location, despite considerable mistreatment. The addition of Gentiles led Christianity to slowly separate from Judaism (second century). Emperor Constantine I legalized Christianity in the Roman Empire by the Order of Milan (313 ), later on convening the Council of Nicaea (325) where Very early Christianity was combined into what would certainly become the state religious beliefs of the Roman Empire (380 ). The Church of the East and Asian Orthodoxy both split over differences in Christology (5th century), while the Eastern Orthodox Church and the Catholic Church separated in the East&ndash;-- West Schism (1054 ). Protestantism divided into numerous religions from the Catholic Church in the Improvement period (16th century). Adhering to the Age of Discovery (15th&ndash;-- 17th century), Christianity expanded throughout the world through missionary work, evangelism, migration and substantial profession. Christianity played a famous function in the growth of Western human being, specifically in Europe from late antiquity and the Center Ages. The six significant branches of Christianity are Roman Catholicism (1. 3 billion people), Protestantism (625 million-900 million), Eastern Orthodoxy (230 million), Oriental Orthodoxy (60 million), Restorationism (35 million), and the Church of the East (600,000). Smaller church communities number in the thousands despite efforts toward unity (ecumenism). In the West, Christianity stays the dominant religion even with a decrease in adherence, with around 70% of that population identifying as Christian. Christianity is expanding in Africa and Asia, the globe&#39;s most populated continents. Christians remain significantly persecuted in many areas of the globe, specifically between East, North Africa, East Asia, and South Asia.</p>
